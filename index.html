      <p> Hello there! My name is Liz Perry and I am currently studying to become a Full-Stack Developer! I am
        beyond excited and nervous to fully immerse myself in this career path, but I hope to showcase my
        artistic and technical skills
        all at once! I am very proud of myself for staying persistent throughout this very difficult course but
        I'm sure my work will
        speak for itself when completed! I have always had an artistic side, but just never felt comfortable
        with a paintbrush or a
        pencil to express myself. Ideas and concepts come to me so easily, but I've never been able to produce
        my vision. However, since I was
        little, I've always had a knack for technology and would be fascinated with how things work or how to
        fix them.</p>

        <p>This sense of curiousity coupled with my ability to learn things fairly quickly, has resulted in several
          years in the IT field. For the
          past few years I've had my artistic side on hold since network security has kept me very busy. However,
          recently I've
          realized it just doesn't scratch that itch for me anymore and I wanted to learn something new. I
          stumbled across web development and
          almost instantly became hooked. You're telling me I can create something aesthetically beautiful but
          also technical and highly
          functional with coding? Yes please! I can have the best of both worlds!
      </p>

      <p>So please feel free to browse through my portfolio and check out the work I've created along the way! I
        hope you enjoy! If you
        would like to contact me, please feel free to do so through the <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">contact</a>
        page!
